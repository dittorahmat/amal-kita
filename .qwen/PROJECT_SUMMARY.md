# Project Summary

## Overall Goal
Integrate the Amal-Kita donation application with a local Odoo Community Edition instance (running at localhost:8096) to automatically create invoices in Odoo when donations are made via the frontend, while maintaining existing donation functionality and ensuring system reliability even if Odoo is unavailable.

## Key Knowledge
- **Application Architecture**: Frontend (React/Vite + TS), Backend (Cloudflare Workers using Hono framework), Storage (Durable Objects)
- **Odoo Configuration**: Running at localhost:8096, with environment variables ODOO_BASE_URL, ODOO_USERNAME, ODOO_PASSWORD, ODOO_DATABASE
- **Integration Flow**: User donation → Frontend → API endpoint → Durable Object Storage → Async Odoo invoice creation
- **Development Setup**: Uses Vite with @cloudflare/vite-plugin; requires `bun run build` before `wrangler dev --port 8787` for code changes to take effect
- **API Protocol**: Odoo XML-RPC API with robust error handling and comprehensive XML response parsing
- **Environment Variables**: Must be defined in `.dev.vars` or `.env` files and are loaded via Vite's loadEnv mechanism
- **Asynchronous Processing**: Uses `c.executionCtx.waitUntil()` for proper async operation in Cloudflare Workers

## Recent Actions
- [DONE] Identified and fixed the critical issue of missing environment variables in `Env` interface in `worker/core-utils.ts`
- [DONE] Enhanced XML-RPC parsing in `worker/services/odoo-service.ts` to handle all response types (integers, strings, arrays, structs, booleans)
- [DONE] Added proper async execution context with `c.executionCtx.waitUntil()` in `worker/user-routes.ts`
- [DONE] Fixed complex domain queries in `getSalesAccount` method by using sequential simple queries
- [DONE] Added comprehensive logging throughout the integration for debugging
- [DONE] Updated `odoo-integration-plan.md` to reflect completed implementation steps
- [DONE] Resolved the issue where `crypto.randomUUID()` was causing errors in Cloudflare Workers by using timestamp-based ID generation
- [DONE] Fixed the build process requirement to compile TypeScript code before development server can see changes
- [DONE] Confirmed that donations made through the frontend successfully create invoices in Odoo
- [DONE] Updated `.gitignore` to include comprehensive protection for sensitive and environment files

## Current Plan
- [COMPLETED] Diagnose why invoices were not being created in Odoo despite all code fixes
- [COMPLETED] Identify missing piece in the integration that prevented actual invoice creation
- [COMPLETED] Verify that the service configuration and execution were correct
- [COMPLETED] Check for any required fields or validation requirements in the Odoo invoice creation payload
- [COMPLETED] Complete end-to-end testing to confirm invoices are created after donations
- [COMPLETED] All integration issues have been resolved and the system is working correctly
- [COMPLETED] The Odoo integration is now fully functional - donations made through the frontend automatically create invoices in Odoo while maintaining all existing functionality
- [COMPLETED] Added DonationConfirmationPage as an intermediate step between donation and success
- [COMPLETED] Implemented Indonesian bank information (BCA, Mandiri, BSI) with proper logos on confirmation page
- [COMPLETED] Added QRIS support with proper image display on confirmation page
- [COMPLETED] Fixed routing issues between confirmation and success pages
